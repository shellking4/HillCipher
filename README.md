# HillCipher implemented in java
This is a fun exercise I did implementing the HillCipher algorithm in an oop way. not quite great but it can be a starting point 
to others. The program is yours to improve and enhance. Cheers :)

`run javac *.java to create java executables from the files then run java Test to run the main process`
